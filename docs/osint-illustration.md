# Assets Directory

This directory would contain images and other assets for the project.

For now, we're using external image URLs for:
- UAISINT logo (LinkedIn)
- LinkedIn QR code (QRServer API)

To add your own images:
1. Add them to this folder
2. Reference them with relative paths like: `./assets/your-image.jpg`
